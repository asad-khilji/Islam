    <p>In Surah Qasas Musa's Mother heart is overwhelmed with emotion</p>
    <p>Allah calmed down the heart</p>
    <p>Both words for heart are used</p>
    <p>Allah calms the heart for all people</p>
    <p>Allah moves you forward</p>
    <p>So you can let go of the past</p>
    <p>Allah gives strength to your heart</p>
    <p>The relationship of the heart is like that with Allah and with people</p>
    <p>Misran means country side</p>
    <p>Misra means Egypt</p>
    <p>Musa helped the Isrealites cross the water and escape from firaun</p>
    <p>They received shade from sun, food, and water in the desert</p>
    <p>Isrealites were ungrateful and said is there only one kind of food</p>
    <p>Can we have different kinds of food</p>
    <p>Musa said go to Misran you will have different kinds of food</p>
    <p>By asking for that they are asking for Misra all over again</p>
    <p>The food they were asking were from slavery</p>
    <p>The one kind of food is from freedom</p>
    <p>The elite from Ancient Egypt eat these foods in this order</p>
    <p>They missed the food from slavery</p>
    <p>It is like saying can we have slavery Egypt</p>
    <p>Why don't you go to another Egypt I mean country side</p>
    <p>In Egypt You are humiliated</p>
    <p>You are stuck, you and your children</p>
    <p>Every year they receive rage upon them</p>
    <p>By asking for Egypt they will be humiliated</p>
    <p>They will be stuck and unable to move</p>
    <p>They will have the rage of Allah upon them</p>
    <p>Musa and Isa came to Isrealites</p>
    <p>When Musa spoke he said O my people</p>
    <p>When Isa spoke he says O Isreal</p>
    <p>To be from a nation your father must be from them</p>
    <p>Musa had a father</p>
    <p>Isa did not have a father</p>

    <a href="index.html"><h1>Surah Al Fatihah Ayah 4</h1></a>

    <nav></nav>

    <main>

   <p>It is only to You we give ourselves in slavery and worship</p>
   <p>We make decisons based on our thinking and what our hearts our compelled towards</p>
   <p>We thought about who Allah is and our emotions were shaken as well as our minds</p>
   <p>Everytime we recite this surah we are starting again with our relationship with Allah</p>
   <p>We must revisit why we are Muslim?</p>
   <p>This is surah is screaming to us to refresh our commitment to Allah</p>
   <p>We made a commitment to Allah not to cross the line throughout my life</p>
   <p>It is a very difficult commitment and we need help</p>
   <p>So the next thing we ask for is Allah's help</p>
   <p>We seek your help and only Your help after exhausting ourselves in effort</p>
   <p>We want to be Allah's slave after knowing He is Rabb, Ar Rahman, Ar Raheem, and Malik Yom Deen</p>
   <p>Now that we are the slaves of Allah we are now worthy of Allah's help</p>
   <p>Allah mentioned slavery first then help second</p>
   <p>We fulfilled our purpose by being a slave first</p>
   <p>First you do the job then you get the benefits</p>
   <p>Allah's help is the added benefit for you</p>
   <p>One part of this ayah is for Allah and the other part is for us</p>
   <p>The help of Allah is granted after exhausting yourself in effort</p>
   <p>There are two scenarios</p>
   <p>In the first scenario you have a flat tire</p>
   <p>Then you ask for help and you sit in the driving seat as he is changing the tire</p>
   <p>In the second scenario you ask for help after exhausting yourself in effort</p>
   <p>There are two extremes</p>
   <p>One extreme is Allah does everything and I do nothing</p>
   <p>The other extreme is I did everything</p>
   <p>Both these extremes are wrong and we have a middle path in our Deen</p>
   <p>We must put in the effort first</p>
   <p>If we do not put the effort in we will not qualify for Allah's help</p>
   <p>The efforts are in our hands and the results are in the hands of Allah</p>
   <p>If we do not show effort then the results from Allah will not come</p>
   <p>When you put in the effort then the results from Allah will come on Allah's terms</p>
   <p>We asked for help but we did not specify what we need help in</p>
   <p>It is because we are so desperate that we are short on words</p>
   <p>For example if you are hanging from a tree about to fall from a cliff you do not say...</p>
   <p>I am falling from this cliff about to fall from such a high altitude</p>
   <p>Instead we just scream HELP!!!</p>
   <p>We also do not specify what we need help in because we need help in everything and the list is too long</p>
   <p>These ayat are about someone finally coming to Islam and finding Allah then desperately asking Allah for help</p>

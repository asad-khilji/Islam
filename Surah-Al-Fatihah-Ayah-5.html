    <nav></nav>

    <main>

   <p>The most desperate need we have is to ask for guidance</p>
   <p>So out of all things to ask for help in we ask to be guided</p>
   <p>We say Guide us on the straight path</p>
   <p>Guidance has been compared to water in the Quran</p>
   <p>You need guidance just like you need water</p>
   <p>Every few hours you need to ask for guidance</p>
   <p>We ask for guidance several times a day every day every few hours</p>
   <p>Allah gives you everything without even you asking Him</p>
   <p>Allah only gives you guidance if you ask Him for it</p>
   <p>Guidance is so easily removed that even the Messenger has to ask for it several times</p>
   <p>Guidance cannot be passed down to your children</p>
   <p>We cannot guide anyone, only Allah guides who He wants</p>
   <p>We must be desperate when we ask for guidance</p>
   <p>For example if you are thirsty you will ask for water</p>
   <p>If you are not dying of thirst then if you are nto given water you will forget about it</p>
   <p>But if you are dying of thirst then you will keep on asking</p>
   <p>And the attitude with which you will ask will be different</p>
   <p>Desperation is not just in words but it is shown in your attitude</p>
   <p>With what attitude do you recite the Fatihah and ask for guidance</p>
   <p>You could recite the Fatihah and not ask for guidance</p>
   <p>You could recite it with proper tajweed and not ask for guidance</p>
   <p>You could say ir in front of the kaaba and not ask for guidance</p>
   <p>Or you could recite the fatihah and desperately ask for guidance</p>
   <p>There is the relationship between the master and the slave</p>
   <p>The slave only does what the master wants</p>
   <p>You cannot be a slave if the master does not give you instructions</p>
   <p>We call Allah our Master and He has given us instructions on what to do</p>
   <p>Guidance and Master are recited together in the Quran</p>
   <p>Guidance is related to the word gift in arabic</p>
   <p>For example when you are lost in the desert the most gift you can get is guidance</p>
   <p>Because even if you have water but no guidance then you will eventually run out of water and die</p>
   <p>But if you have guidance you can find your way out of the desert</p>
   <p>The biggest lifeline for the lost is guidance</p>
   <p>There is difference between having knowledge and having guidance</p>
   <p>You can have a lot knowledge and not have guidance</p>
   <p>You can be a Muslim and not have guidance</p>
   <p>Guidance is not one act</p>
   <p>When someone accepted Islam they took their first guided act</p>
   <p>Every moment is a series of decisions</p>
   <p>You could make the right decision or the wrong decision</p>
   <p>In every decision you need someones advice</p>
   <p>Allah is offering His advice to us through His guidance</p>
   <p>There will never be a point where you can say I have guidance</p>
   <p>How much you are moved in your prayer is a good litmus test on how guided you are</p>
   <p>Seerat is a stright path that is wide, long, and upwards</p>
   <p>Other people are on the road with you</p>
   <p>Some people are next to you and some are ahead and some are behind</p>
   <p>We usually ask directions to the destination but not the path</p>
   <p>In the Fatihah we ask to be guided to the path not the destination</p>
   <p>Because in this life our destination is the path</p>
   <p>We have to continue to make progress in this life</p>
   <p>We should compare ourselves to anyone else except ourselves</p>
   <p>Compare yourself with yourself from yesterday</p>
   <p>Allah made all of us different</p>
   <p>We could be inspired by each other but we each have our own paths</p>
   <p>This path is upwards which means it is difficult</p>
   <p>You are going up but gravity or your temptations are pulling you down</p>
   <p>You are either going up or going down but never stationary</p>
   <p>Do not mix knowledge with guidance</p>
   <p>Seek knowledge but never forget why you are seeking knowledge</p>
   <p>If you forget why you are seeking knowledge you could easily became arrogant</p>
   <p>But knowledge is supposed to make you humble</p>
   <p>We are slaves and slaves are supposed to be humble</p>
   <p>The straight path is upwards</p>
   <p>The higher up you get the more dangerous it is</p>
   <p>Then if you get so high then fall from such a height then you sink into the earth and get so immersed in the world</p>

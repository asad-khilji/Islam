   <p>Fulfilling the dua of Ibrahim</p>
   <p>Surah Quresh is about how Allah provided Quresh with prosperity</p>
   <p>Provided with all kinds of fruit</p>

   <p>They should honor the legacy of Ibrahim</p>
   <p>Surah Maun Allah mentions to Worship Allah sincerely</p>
   <p>You serve people</p>
   <p>Ibrahim was very generous</p>
   <p>Quresh were not so generous</p>
   <p>They would not even do a simple act of kindness</p>
   <p>They would not even a spoon of salt</p>
   <p>In Surah Kauthar Prophet Muhammad fulfills the legacy of Ibrahim</p>
   <p>Allah gave Him Kauthar</p>
   <p>Prophet was asked to pray and sacrifice</p>
   <p>Pray and sacrifice is the legacy of Ibrahim</p>
   <p>Your enemy will be cut off</p>
   <p>In Surah Kafiroon Allah says say O Disbelievers</p>
   <p>Prophet has nothing to do with Quresh</p>
   <p>They abandoned the legacy of Ibrahim</p>
   <p>This is a declaration of war</p>
   <p>This becomes treason in tribal society</p>
   <p>In Surah nasr The victory has been given to Prophet by Allah</p>
   <p>So increase in tasbeeh and forgiveness</p>
   <p>The people will enter the religion in crowds</p>
   <p>Although the victory does not happen right away</p>
   <p>You see the clouds of rain</p>
   <p>You can see victory coming</p>
   <p>In Surah masad Allah mentions how He took care of Prophet's enemy</p>
   <p>It set the Prophet at ease to know victory is granted</p>
   <p>A sign and some hope to set your heart at ease</p>
   <p>Allah does not wait for Prophet to ask for a sign</p>
   <p>In Surah Ikhlas Allah reminds us and refreshes our imaan</p>
   <p>While you are fighting you forget what you are fighting for</p>
   <p>You need to remind yourself</p>
   <p>You need to renew your intention</p>
   <p>You need to be sincere</p>
   <p>Struggle only for Allah</p>
   <p>Keep your focus</p>
   <p>Struggle was about the legacy of Ibrahim</p>
   <p>Legacy of Ibrahim was Tawheed</p>
   <p>The constitution of this faith</p>
   <p>The oneness of Allah</p>
   <p>In Surah Falaq You ask for protection from the outside</p>
   <p>Do not fall to the traps of shaytan</p>

   <p>You cannot fall into shirk</p>
   <p>In Surah Nas You need to protect your self from the inside</p>
   <p>The devils from man and jinn</p>
   <p>Who whisper in the chests of people</p>
   <p>Heart is a thing and chest is a place</p>
   <p>Devils are given access to our chests</p>
   <p>They do not have access to our hearts</p>
   <p>Only we can let them inside</p>
   <p>Allah describes the scene of the people of Jannah and people of hellfire</p>

    <main>

    <p>If Groups A & B are fighting then C should make peace</p>
    <p>If A fights B again then B & C should fight A</p>
    <p>If A wants peace again then C should judge with justice and fair</p>
    <p>Adl and kist</p>
    <p>This is when Muminoon are fighting</p>
    <p>It is embarrassing when we are fighting each other</p>
    <p>The peace agreement is made in private</p>
    <p>If you fight again then next agreement is in public</p>
    <p>How you live your life?</p>
    <p>How you earn your money?</p>
    <p>Live your lives with justice</p>
    <p>Battle of Uhud</p>
    <p>Muslims suffered a lot</p>
    <p>Allah put us through this scenario so he can cleanse those who believe</p>
    <p>When you purify gold</p>
    <p>Gold is melted turned into liquid and the impurities come to the top</p>
    <p>The dirt withers away and you get pure gold</p>
    <p>Believers cannot be cleaned until they are put to the flames</p>
    <p>The flames of war</p>
    <p>The hypocrites are impurities who exposed themselves at uhud</p>
    <p>Allah called the sahaba Gold</p>
    <p>Allah has a conversation with 3 groups of people and it has an effect on each group</p>
    <p>The three groups are Bani Israel, Prophet, and Ummah all in one ayah</p>
    <p>Allah says to Bani Israel I gave you shade with clouds</p>
    <p>We sent on to you manna and salwa</p>
    <p>Eat and drink from the things I provided you</p>
    <p>Allah says to us They did not wrong Me, they only wronged themselves</p>
    <p>Half the ayah is about Bani Israel</p>
    <p>Half the ayah is about us</p>
    <p>Watch it we are next </p>
    <p>They will be eating fruits and they will be enjoying themselves</p>
    <p>They feel secure protected and happy</p>
    <p>It is distant in terms of time and space</p>
    <p>Eat and drink care free</p>
    <p>we travel through time and now we are sitting in Jannah</p>
    <p>half the ayah is in the future</p>
    <p>the other half of the ayah we time travel to the future</p>
    <p>Imagine yourself in the future</p>
    <p>Eat and drink because of the good things you did</p>
    <p>Which is now the present, we must do more good deeds</p>
    <p>The real gift of the ayah is talking to Allah</p>
    <p>They say Ar Rahman took a son</p>
    <p>You have come forward with something hideous</p>
    <p>Why switch from they to you</p>
    <p>There are two students who cheated on the test</p>
    <p>Teacher says some people think they can get away with teaching</p>
    <p>Then the teacher mentions a name</p>
    <p>Quran has its own standard</p>
    <p>This transtition is incorrect in other languages</p>
    <p>He Allah is the one who makes things easy for you on the land and sea</p>
    <p>Until the time when you board on to ships</p>
    <p>And then the ships start sailing away with them with good winds</p>
    <p>And they are very happy with the winds</p>
    <p>Beautiful breeze, sunny skies</p>
    <p>All of a sudden a tornado, hurricane wind attacks them</p>
    <p>Then the waves start hitting the ship from every direction</p>
    <p>They realize that they going to be overcome</p>
    <p>Then they turn to Allah and there is no distraction</p>
    <p>They say if you were to rescue me, I will be from the grateful</p>
    <p>Muslims are surrounded in the battle of the trench</p>
    <p>Enemies are coming from both sides</p>
    <p>They came from above you and below you</p>
    <p>Allah provides the aerial view</p>
    <p>When eyes were petrified you would not even blink</p>
    <p>And you hearts were jumping into your throats</p>
    <p>And you were making all kind of thought s about Allah</p>
    <p>Allah was watching with full view what you were doing</p>
    <p>Allah is the wali of those who believe</p>
    <p>Those who disbelieve their wali are the taghoot</p>
    <p>Wali is a friend you wants to protect</p>
    <p>Moula is the one who actually protects you</p>
    <p>The comparison is between Allah and the believers</p>
    <p>Comparison between taghoot and disbelievers</p>
    <p>In most relationships there is primary and secondary</p>
    <p>Allah is primary between us and Him</p>
    <p>Taghoot is secondary to disbelievers</p>
    <p>Allah does not put taghoot in the same place as Himself</p>
    <p>Allah is changing the sequence of the ayah on purpose</p>
    <p>That is because Allah is the Moula of those who believe</p>
    <p>The disbelievers have no Moula</p>
    <p>The jinn traveled in the sky</p>
    <p>They stealed some info from the angels</p>
    <p>They caused fitnah in the earth</p>
    <p>They had places in the sky they would hang out</p>
    <p>When the Quran came down the entire sky was locked down</p>
    <p>There is an entire army of angels</p>
    <p>They would be shot down by meteorites and falling skies</p>
    <p>Jinn are hanging on the earth and the heard the Quran</p>
    <p>Jinn were amazed by the Quran</p>
    <p>Jinn immediately recognized the Quran</p>
    <p>Jinn were not sure if Allah destined good for us</p>
    <p>Or is evil was intended</p>
    <p>Jinn did not mention evil with Allah because it is part of good manners</p>
    <p>Allah gave an example and the believers pay more attention</p>
    <p>An example was given and the disbelievers pay more attention</p>
    <p>Speech is judged by who said it, how is it being said, and what is being said</p>
    <p>I ate a burger</p>
    <p>I eat a burger</p>
    <p>Past tense happen only one time</p>
    <p>Present tense happens continuously</p>
    <p>Dream of Ibrahim and dream of Yusuf</p>
    <p>Ibrahim says I see in my dream I am slaughtering you</p>
    <p>Yusuf says I saw 11 stars the sun and moon</p>
    <p>Whoever killed by mistake</p>
    <p>Whoever kills on purpose</p>
    <p>Every person will be paid, humans view time because it has not happened yet its in the future</p>
    <p>Every person was paid, Allah views time because Allah knows the future</p>
    <p>Different ways of saying no</p>
    <p>If you are Pakistani you are at someone house</p>
    <p>They say some tea, you say no</p>
    <p>Which means yes hurry up</p>
    <p>No means yes</p>
    <p>No means absolutely no</p>
    <p>There is not room for any doubt</p>
    <p>There is some room for doubt</p>
    <p>Ibrahim makes a dua to Make this a peaceful city</p>
    <p>Ibrahim makes a dua to Make this city peaceful</p>
    <p>Ibrahim makes a dua to Bring peace and fruits to this city</p>
    <p>Fruits and peace meaning economic security and prosperity</p>
    <p>To have a stable society</p>
    <p>Strong economy and law and order</p>
    <p>You could be robbed or you have no job</p>
    <p>Problems, resistance to government</p>
    <p>Allah knows what comes out down from the sky and what goes up to the sky</p>
    <p>Physical up and down and spiritual up and down</p>
    <p>When going into the ground we look for Allah love and care</p>
    <p>When coming out of the ground we look for Allah forgiveness</p>
    <p>Rahim Ghafoor is about all creation</p>
    <p>Ghafoor Rahim is primarily about humans</p>

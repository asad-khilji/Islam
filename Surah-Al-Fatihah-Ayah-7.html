    <main>

   <p>But not the path of those of those who had wrath directed upon them</p>
   <p>Nor of those who are lost</p>
   <p>In ayah 6 a verb is used because those who Allah has favored are only found in the past</p>
   <p>This ayah is noun based which means those who had anger upon them are a timeless problem</p>
   <p>You will find these people in the past present and future</p>
   <p>Those who received anger are those who had beneficial knowledge but did not act upon it</p>
   <p>Those who are lost are those who had no knowledge but acted wrongly</p>
   <p>Those who had wrath upon them are the Jews mentioned in the Quran but not all the Jews</p>
   <p>Those who are lost are the Christians mentioned in the Quran but not all the Christians</p>
   <p>There is an example of Imad and Waleed</p>
   <p>I go upstairs for a phone call and the two boys are looking at the cookies</p>
   <p>Before I go I tell Imad not to eat the cookies</p>
   <p>Waleed can't eat them either but I leave Imad in charge and tell him not to eat</p>
   <p>When I come back I see Imad and Waleed eating the cookies</p>
   <p>I am angry at Imad because he knew not to eat the cookies but still did so</p>
   <p>I am angry at Waleed but not as much as Imad</p>
   <p>Waleed did not know but he should of asked me not Imad</p>
   <p>This is the analogy between those who had wrath upon them and those who are lost</p>

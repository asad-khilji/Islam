    <nav></nav>

    <main>

    <p>All we can do with the word of Allah is ponder, wonder, & inquire</p>
    <p>Whatever we conclude we say Allah knows best</p>
    <p>This is not the only reason why the Quran is so great</p>
    <p>Every Ayah of the Quran is a vast ocean</p>
    <p>You pull one thing out from the ocean but it is not the only thing</p>
    <p>You do not have to agree with anybody</p>
    <p>Each person finds their own gems</p>
    <p>It is an human endeavor of pondering over the Quran</p>
    <p>This endeavor started with the Sahaba</p>
    <p>They did not hate each other over these differences</p>
    <p>There are ayat about ibadah which are timeless</p>
    <p>There are ayat about creation which have different perspectives</p>
    <p>Everything said is a great exhaustions of the human mind</p>
    <p>Human effort is subject to error</p>
    <p>You go to the ocean and each person dives in and find pearls</p>
    <p>Another person finds something else</p>
    <p>Third person says forget pearls I found something awesome</p>
    <p>I do not even have a word for it yet</p>
    <p>Jurist, Historian, politicians, each study the Quran and find miracles</p>
    <p>Laws, history, language, scientific phenomena, tajweed</p>
    <p>It is a miracles for none of them and all of the all at the same time</p>
    <p>We will never know the Quran</p>
    <p>We can only think about the Quran</p>
    <p>Because we are struggling to reach a conclusion</p>
    <p>It is only Allah who truly knows</p>
    <p>the word surah comes from the word sawra</p>
    <p>it means a really sharp eyesight and view</p>
    <p>A long reaching view</p>
    <p>A big wall that surrounds a city and it is hard to climb</p>
    <p>The walls protect from intruders</p>
    <p>To be on top of a large scaling wall</p>
    <p>There is a lot going on inside a surah</p>
    <p>Everything works together and comes together</p>
    <p>Everything inside a surah is interconnected</p>
    <p>It becomes more beautiful when everything works together to create a scene</p>
    <p>The Quran is made of 114 surahs</p>
    <p>Some are makki and some are madani</p>
    <p>2/3 of the Quran is Makki</p>
    <p>1/3 is Madani</p>
    <p>The Quran is not in chronological order</p>
    <p>The Quran is not in revelation order</p>
    <p>The Quran is not in subject order</p>
    <p>The Quran is not in size order</p>
    <p>The Quran is in perfect order</p>
    <p>The Quran has its own standard</p>
    <p>The sahaba came to an agreement on the order of the Quran</p>
    <p>The Quran is in the order Allah intended it to be</p>
    <p>The Quran is in Divine order and Symmetrical order</p>
    <p>All Praise and Thanks belongs to Allah</p>
    <p>Who crafted things in the most perfect way and the most perfect order</p>
    <p>Who made things in subtle craft</p>
    <p>The one who puts things in the most perfect place</p>
    <p>I send prayers and salutations on the one who was aided by Allah</p>
    <p>with the most eloquent of all speech.</p>
    <p>This is the book I wrote to show you how the Quran is in Perfect Order</p>
    <p>The one who created this universe and knew where to place the earth</p>
    <p>And to place the sun and the stars</p>
    <p>The one who knew where to place the fingers of the human being</p>
    <p>The one who knew where to place every portion of my brain</p>
    <p>Where to put my nose and where to put my mouth</p>
    <p>Does not know where to put the surahs of the Quran</p>
    <p>And He left that to me. No I cannot accept it</p>
    <p>I think the Quran is the perfect and best speech ever</p>
    <p>How can the Quran be the best speech and it is not organized, impossible</p>
    <p>May Allah forgive all those who disagree with me</p>
    <p>Quran came down in 23 years</p>
    <p>It is being memorized</p>
    <p>Prophet recited the entire Quran twice</p>
    <p>Zaid ibn Thabbit was with the Prophet</p>
    <p>Quran is to be compiled in book form in time Abu Bakr</p>
    <p>Zaid ibn Thabbit is in charge of it</p>
    <p>Zaid ibn Thabbit is evidence that Quran is in order Prophet recited</p>
    <p>It is impossible to have agreement on one order</p>
    <p>There are thousands of sahaba</p>
    <p>114 surahs and a lot of sequences possible</p>
    <p>there is not one alternative sequence</p>
    <p>sometimes Prophet mixed up the surahs in salah</p>
    <p>sahaba also mixed the reading of Quran</p>
    <p>there is no discussion on what order of surahs should be</p>
    <p>because it is clear to sahaba that it comes from Prophet</p>
    <p>When it comes from Prophet it is divine</p>
    <p>Sahaba had agreement because they knew it to be from Allah</p>
    <p>Allah says in Surah Qiyama No doubt about it our responsibility it is to gather it and get it recited</p>
    <p>It is entirely on Allah to put the Quran in perfect order</p>
    <p>Allah says in Surah Burooj That written document is protected in a fort</p>
    <p>The Quran in written form and recited form</p>
    <p>It is a majestic Quran in guarded tablet</p>
    <p>What you are reciting here is identical to guarded tablet</p>
    <p>The spoken is identical to a written</p>
    <p>Tablets are considered solid</p>
    <p>You engraving on a tablet</p>
    <p>You cannot change anything on tablet</p>
    <p>It is written on stone</p>
    <p>The third kalimah in Surah Isra and Kahf</p>
    <p>Surah Isra is about Jews and mentions Story of Adam with arrogance of Iblis</p>
    <p>Surah Kahf is about Christians and mentions story of Adam with Iblis being a Jinn</p>

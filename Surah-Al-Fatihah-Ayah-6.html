    <main>

   <p>The path of those whom you favored</p>
   <p>The path that is made smooth and luxurious</p>
   <p>Like a path going up an escalator</p>
   <p>These people made effort and Allah made the path easy for them</p>
   <p>These people are only found in the past</p>
   <p>You take advice from those who already tread this path</p>
   <p>Those who Allah has guided in the past</p>
   <p>The Quran is full of stories of people of the past</p>
   <p>Every story will help you on this path</p>
   <p>Their stories are my companions on this journey</p>
   <p>These people are the Prophets</p>
   <p>Those who confirmed truth in the Prophets</p>
   <p>The martyrs</p>
   <p>And the righteous</p>
   <p>Those who had beneficial knowledge and acted upon it</p>

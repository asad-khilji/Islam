    <p>Rahma comes from the same root word as the womb of the mother</p>
    <p>Rahm is the womb of the mother</p>
    <p>In this state you do not have to worry about anything</p>
    <p>Everything is taken care of for you</p>
    <p>The child is comletely wrapped up in the care of the mother</p>
    <p>The child has no idea what Allah does to take care of you</p>
    <p>The Rahma of Allah is similiar in this way</p>
    <p>The heart is pumping blood constantly and we are unaware</p>
    <p>We are not even remembering Allah and He is still taking care of us</p>
    <p>We are just as ignorant as a child in the womb of the mother</p>
    <p>Allah does all this out of unconditional love and care for us</p>
    <p>Allah is taking care of us all the time constantly</p>
    <p>The mother goes out of the way to take care of us</p>
    <p>There are three qualities of the word Ar Rahman</p>
    <p>The first quality is that Allah is extremely loving and caring</p>
    <p>The second quality of Ar Rahman is that Allah's extreme love and care for us is immediate</p>
    <p>The third quality of Ar Rahman is that the extreme love and care of Allah is temporary</p>
    <p>There are two qualities of the word Ar Raheem</p>
    <p>The first quality is that Allah is always extreme loving and caring</p>
    <p>The second quality is that Allah's extreme love and care for us is not happening right now</p>
    <p>For example your wife is making dinner</p>
    <p>While making dinner she says what do you want to eat tomorrow</p>
    <p>You say I do not care about tomorrow I need to eat right now</p>
    <p>Then after you eat you say what about tomorrow we can have this or that</p>
    <p>We need our immediate needs taken care of first then our future needs</p>
    <p>Allah mentions His name Ar Rahman first then Ar Raheem</p>
    <p>Allah takes care of our immediate needs first then he takes care of our future</p>
    <p>Allah knows who He created that we are impatient human beings</p>
    <p>Ibn Abbas said Ar Rahman is for everyone in this world</p>
    <p>Ar Raheem is for believers in the next life</p>
    <p>You cannot imagine an ocean with high waves and calm waves both at the same time</p>
    <p>The qualities of Ar Rahman is like an ocean with high waves</p>
    <p>The qualities of Ar Raheem is like an ocean with calm waves</p>
    <p>Allah is both qualities at the same time</p>
    <p>The love and care of Allah is beyond human comprehension</p>
    <p>Surah Al Fatihah begins with Praise and Thanks is for Allah</p>
    <p>Then we call Allah our Master</p>
    <p>And the quality of that Master is being extremely loving and caring</p>
    <p>Now tell me what other Master other than Allah is associated with this quality</p>
    <p>There is no one else this much loving and caring</p>
    <p>You cannot even be loving and caring to your own self</p>
    <p>Whatever Allah tells us is because He loves us</p>
    <p>Whatever Allah tells us to do it benefits us only</p>
    <p>Allah does not benefit from it and does not need anything</p>

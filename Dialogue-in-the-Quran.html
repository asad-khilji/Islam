    <p>Surah Al Shu ara

        The Dialogue between Musa and Firaun
        No doubt about your Master is truly in Authority
        Your Master is always Loving and Caring
        Allah Authority will manifest against Firawn
        Allah’s Love and Care will be with Musa
        When your master made a call to Musa
        Go to the wrong doing nation
        Right now musa is on top of the mountian talking to allah
        Which wrong doing nation
        The nation of firawn
        Don’t they have any taqwa
        The problem is Musa is a fugitive who ran away from murder
        What Irony
        When he left he had to make sure nobody saw him
        When he goes back he needs to make sure everybody saw him
        Musa says…
        Master I am afraid they will call me a liar
        My chest becomes tight and I get frustrated
        My tongue stops moving and I have a stutter
        Then send the message to Haroon also
        They have a crime listed against me, they may kill me
        Musa realizes his life means nothing compared with the Mission he is given
        Allah says…
        No Problem
        It is not like how we say no problem
        Everything is taken care of
        Then both of you go with our Miraculous signs
        Allah took care of all his concerns
        And gave him what he did not even ask for
        No doubt We will be listening alongside all of you
        Allah will send a legion of Angels with you
        Allah will also listen to all the people
        We will be listening closely and carefully
        Allah listened carefully What about us?
        Both of you go to Firawn
        They had to start with Firawn
        Go to Firawn and say to him We are the Messenger of Master of all nations and send all bani Israel along with us
        Both Musa and Haroon are inseparable Messengers
        Musa is on the Mountain
        He has to go to Firawn
        It is a long journey
        Musa And Haroon walk in and say you are not the king
        
        If you know what is good for you you will do as I say
        
        What happens when you talk like this to a king
        
        Musa makes to points to him
        
        Firawn responded Did I not raise you as a newborn and spent many years here
        
        Allah fast forwarded to when they speak to Firawn
        We get straight to the point
        So Firawn puts Musa in his place
        Firawn says You did that thing you did and you were from the deniers (kafireen)
        
        Firawn addressed one of the points
        He completed changed the subject
        Musa says
        
        Yes I did that thing I did, Musa did not expose himself
        And I was confused at that time
        And I ran away from all of you when I used to be afraid you
        After running aways Allah made me a Messenger
        Musa stayed on point and back on topic
        By the way thanks for the favor you did for me
        Did you provide me that housing so it justifies slaving the Israelites
        Musa changes back the subject and makes him look stupid
        Everybody in the court is listening to him
        
        People working under Firawn are getting a laugh
        
        Firawn says
        
        What lord of the worlds?
        Musa says
        
        Master of all the skies and earth and whatever is in between
        If anybody wants to be convinced
        Musa defied the King, talkback to the King,
        Pharoahs believed in the sun God
        Pharoahs are the sons of the sun
        Allah is the Master of all the skies and earth
        Musa mentioned another God 3 times
        Nobody is offended because they do not truly believe Firawn is Rabb
        Some people are enjoying this and curious
        Firawn is angry because nobody is angry
        Firawn says
        
        Are you people not listening to what he is saying
        Why don’t you defend him?
        Musa says
        
        He is your Master and the Master of all your ancestors
        They believed their ancestors were sacred
        Musa stays calm
        Firawn becomes angry
        The tables have turned
        Musa is winning the conversation
        Allah is moving the balances of power inside the court room
        Firawn says
        
        To his people this Messenger of yours is crazy
        Because it felt like they believed in him
        Stop listening to him
        Musa says
        
        He is also the Master of the east and the west
        If you people understand
        They believed that Pharoahs were Rabb of east and west
        They owned the Egyptian land
        Musa says Allah owns the Egyptian
        Musa says get rid of this idiot and worship the true God
        Firawn realizes it is becoming dangerous for his kingdom
        Firawn says
        
        If you take any other God besides me I will make sure to throw you prison
        In prison among others
        To instill fear in the room
        Musa shows them some signs because anymore talking he will be arrested
        
        When you have a debate with someone if he responds with a threat of force you have accepted the defeat of your arguments
        
        Firawn admitted that he was wrong
        
        Everybody in the room knows that Firawn has been defeated
        
        Musa says
        
        You will arrest me even if I show you a clear sign
        Firawn says
        
        Go ahead show me what you can if you are truthful
        Musa threw his staff then it turned into a massive python
        
        Python large enough to swallow a goat
        Fangs sticking out ready to bite
        Looks so terrifying it looks like a jinn
        It is moving around very quickly
        Musa owned people’s ears and now their eyes
        
        Musa puts his hand in his arm under his arm and it turned white
        
        All the attention is on Musa and no attention is on Firawn
        
        This is really bad for Firawn
        
        Firawn says to his generals because he is worried they will be impressed
        
        This no doubt is a knowledgeable magician
        I think he wants to get all of you kicked out of your land
        It is the first time he called his land anybody else land
        He thinks rivers flow beneath my feet
        So tell me what to do
        It is any indication that Firawn became weak
        He makes his generals feel special
        Maybe some of them got emotional
        They say
        
        Let this go
        Let his brothers go
        Make a huge gathering
        Bring the best of magicians
        They will defeat Musa
         
        
        In the meantime Musa went to the nations to preach the message
        
        One of the people in the room tells some people
        
        It spreads and the next day all of Egypt knew
        
        Firawn reputation went down
        
        Musa reputation went up
        
        Magicians realized this to
        
        Firawn’s election is going down
        
        He is not so great
        
         
        
        Soldiers told people we are going to defeat the threat of this nation
        
        Come with your family
        
        Bring a flag with you
        
        Are you coming or not?
        
        A pretend form of patriotism
        
         
        
        Magician’s looked better than Firawn
        
        People might end up following the Magicians
        
         
        
        Magician’s say to Firawn
        
        Are we getting paid?
         
        
        Firawn says to the Magicians
        
        Yes you will be paid
        You will be from among those close to me
        He gave them cabinet positions
         
        
        Musa says
        
        Throw whatever it is you are going to throw
         
        
        They threw their ropes by the Authority of Firawn we will be the ones who will win
        
        Musa threw his staff
        
        Then all of a sudden it swallowed all of what they had immediately
        
        Then the Magicians fell into sajdah
        
        Magicians had imaan inside and the imaan gushed forth after this expierence
        
         
        
        Magicians get up from sajdah and say
        
        We believe in the Lord of all people
         
        
        Firawn says
        
        I know you believe in me
        Keep going come up with round 2
         
        
        The Magicians say
        
        No stupid we believe in the Master of Musa and Haroon
         
        
        Firawn gathered all the people to gather and come out
        
        He spent millions of dollars in this campaign
        
        Then he lost
        
        He forced everyone to come out and listen to the Magicians
        
        Magicians said lets belief in Musa
        
         
        
        Firawn says
        
        You believed in him before I gave you permission
        He is your big chief
        The one who taught you magic
        He made this up for the crown 
        You people will soon find out
        First I will cut you’re your limbs from opposite sides
        Then I will hang you and crucify you altogether
        He is worried about leaving an example for the public
         
        
        Magician’s say
        
        No problem
        We will return to our master anyway
         
        
        The Quran is a living text
        
        It takes you inside a world
        
        It is so underestimated
        
        We need to make the Quran accessible to everybody
        
        To Muslims and non Muslims
        
        In all languages
        
        All people should learn the Arabic Language

    <p>Oaths in General

        When you are angry
        When you are not being believed
        When testifying in Court
        Oaths in Old Arabic
        
        When you are angry
        When you are not being believed
        When testifying in Court
        To get your attention
        Oaths in the Quran
        
        When you are angry
        When you are not being believed
        When testifying in Court
        To get your attention
        Object of the oath and subject of the oath
        I swear by time mankind is in loss
        The object of the oath is time
        The subject of the oath is man is in loss
        The object of the oath prepares you for the subject of the oath
        The object of the oath is used as evidence for the subject of the oath
        I swear by the orange sky
        
        And the night as it gets super dark
        
        And the moon as it gets full
        
        You people are going to ride one stage after the next
        
        When the sky is orange it is Maghreb time
        
        Maghreb is inevitable and nightfall is coming
        
        The night took stages
        
        When it is super black then you see the moon
        
        The moon has stages
        
        We will also go in stages
        
        From the womb to Jannah / Jahannum
        
        If you forget there is no way out of this cycle just remembers the oaths
        
        Surah Al Adiyat
        
        Allah swears by horses going into battle
        These female horse are trained to run extra fast
        These are aggressive horse which are less than 10
        There are riding and panting
        When they strike the rock sparks fly even though it is wet
        They charge in the morning like a suicide mission
        They cause clouds of dust to rise
        They penetrate the lines of the forces and get right in the middle
        This is a trailer in the Quran
        No doubt the human being is not loyal to its master
        Animal has certain instincts of survival
        This horse is so loyal to its master then it runs to its death
        What about you how come you are not loyal
        Conditions of a good example
        
        Easy to follow
        Relatable
        Leads you to the lesson
        It is clear
        Straight to the point
        Came back to the original lesson
        People that are solely dedicated to Allah and whoever would associate shirk with Allah is like someone who is falling from the sky and birds are chewing from him and the wind blows him away to an unchartered location
        
        This ayah is about people who do shirk
        They have no concept of the afterlife
        When you believe this is the only life then what of you is left after
        Humans beings still have a desire to live on even in the world
        People do stuff so their name can be remembered
        Some people give their donations at the time of death
        Statue and name is remembered
        Arabs would love going into fights
        They would like to live on to show his fight skills
        People on bottom came to top and killed them threw them off cliff
        The person died the death of a loser or the death of a coward
        Shirk is a humiliating thing
        These dead soldiers are such an embarrassment that no body came to bury them
        Their funerals service became the vultures
        The rest over is blown off to unchartered locations
        Then you hearts became like stone or even harder than stone, some stones rivers gush forth, some stones crack open and some water comes out, some stones fall from the fear of Allah and Allah is not unaware of what you do
        
        This is about different kinds of hearts
        You have two friends
        One friend
        is very quiet and loves to read,
        They stay to themselves introverted person
        Another Friend
        The opposite of the first
        Very extroverted
        Always want to do something
        Very hyper active
        The three of you go on a road trip together
        The extrovert says lets go somewhere
        Lets go eat something
        The quiet one says have you wondered about the sky
        The extrovert says no but I am wondering about the next restaurant stop
        Imam siraj wahhaj gives 20 min speech and gets you excited
        Another scholar gives a 5 hour lecture on Hadith
        The extrovert likes Imam sirhaj wahhaj
        The introvert likes the scholar
        Abu bakr was introverted
        Umar was extroverted
        Abu Bakr accepted Islam Iman just gushed out like a river
        Umar accepts after some cracks and some water came out
        Other people just fall from the fear of Allah
        Water symbolizes water
        The three types of hearts are
        Mohsin
        Mumin
        Muslim
        This example is relatable to Bani Israel when Musa striked the rock with his staff and water gushed forth</p>

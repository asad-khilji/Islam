    <a href="index.html"><h1>Sequencing in the Quran</h1></a>

    <nav></nav>

    <main>

    <p>Allah says in the Quran Days and Night</p>
    <p>Also Allah says Night and Day</p>
    <p>We are used to saying things a certain way</p>
    <p>The Quran is really remarkable</p>
    <p>Allah breaks the speech pattern and mixes it up</p>
    <p>Allah changes His speech pattern even too rapidly</p>
    <p>In Surah Mulk Allah says Say He is Ar Rahman we have believed in Him and upon Him we rely</p>
    <p>In this unusual sequencing Allah says we only rely on Allah</p>
    <p>We believe in Allah and other things as well</p>
    <p>Allah says it so accurately in a split second</p>
    <p>When we speak we make tons of grammatical mistakes</p>
    <p>The Quran was given to humanity in the form of speech</p>
    <p>There is no room for correction in speech unlike written</p>
    <p>We recite once, the final version we are still reciting now</p>
    <p>In Surah Kahf Allah says How well He sees and How well He hears</p>
    <p>In the rest of the Quran Allah mentions hearing first and seeing second</p>
    <p>The sequenced is reversed</p>
    <p>These two times the pattern is broken</p>
    <p>We see and we hear</p>
    <p>It is talking about the people of the cave</p>
    <p>The real problem was that nobody could see them</p>
    <p>Allah wanted to highlight nobody knew where they were</p>
    <p>Allah sees them so well</p>
    <p>Allah hears the most intimate conversation between friends</p>
    <p>The Quran has its unique perspective on history</p>
    <p>It is Allah's perspective on history</p>
    <p>They see the hellfire and they say we are ready to listen</p>
    <p>Do not kill your children because of poverty, we provide you and them</p>
    <p>Do not kill your children out of fear of poverty we provide them and you</p>
    <p>Allah placed a seal upon his heart and hearing</p>
    <p>Allah placed a seal upon his hearing and his heart</p>
    <p>When they saw business or entertainment they left and left you standing there</p>
    <p>What Allah has is better than entertainment and better than business</p>
    <p>In Ayat Birr Allah is saying Being Good isn't only that you turn your faces to the east and west alone</p>
    <p>The entire discussion before this is about the changing of the qibla</p>
    <p>The above statement creates a question</p>
    <p>What else is good?</p>
    <p>The Quran makes you asks a question</p>
    <p>The definition of goodness is given thereafter</p>
    <p>This is an example of teaching methodology</p>
    <p>Two distinct subjects being good and change of qibla</p>
    <p>It is a natural flow of conversation</p>
    <p>Mufoona and sabirina</p>
    <p>What did it change?</p>
    <p>Allah is emphasizing how much important you need sabr</p>
    <p>The 9 sentences of Ayat ul Kursi are symmetrical to each other</p>
    <p>His chair held the skies and the earth</p>
    <p>Every other verb in the ayah is in the present tense</p>
    <p>The chair held is in the past tense</p>
    <p>This means that the maximum capacity was not reached</p>
    <p>It is a matter of fact and not just a matter of potential</p>
    <p>How much bigger is the chair than the seven heavens</p>
    <p>It is like a ring in a desert</p>
    <p>Allah says My love and care held all things</p>

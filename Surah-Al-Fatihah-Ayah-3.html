    <nav></nav>

    <main>

    <p>The first three ayat of Surah Al Fatihah introduce us to Allah</p>
    <p>Praise and Thanks belongs to Allah because He is Rabb, Ar Rahman, Ar Raheem, and Malik Yom Ad Deen</p>
    <p>When someone is extremely loving and caring, people take adavantage of their love and care</p>
    <p>Some people take it as an open license to do whatever they want</p>
    <p>Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem is two most beautiful qualities of Allah</p>
    <p>But it can create an imbalance in people and people can take advantage of the love and care of Allah</p>
    <p>There is a story of a Master and a slave</p>
    <p>The Master tells the slave do whatever you want but do not cross the fence</p>
    <p>One day the slave goes close to the line and trips on the other side of the fence</p>
    <p>The master sees and says nothing</p>
    <p>The next day the slave pretends to fall and master says nothing</p>
    <p>Now the slave has one foot on one side of the fence and the other foot on the other side of the fence</p>
    <p>The master says nothing</p>
    <p>The slave spends all his time on the other side of the fence</p>
    <p>Then one day the master calls the slave over</p>
    <p>The master says to the slave remeber I told you not to cross the fence</p>
    <p>The slave says yes</p>
    <p>The master says I recorded all the times you crossed the fence and decided to punish you now all at once</p>
    <p>We call Allah our Master and He told us not to cross certain lines</p>
    <p>When some of us slip into sin we immediately repent and turn back to Allah</p>
    <p>Then we realize nothing happened and that Allah is extremely loving and caring so we fall more into sin</p>
    <p>When people remind us not to sin we often say Allah is Ar Rahman Ar Raheem</p>
    <p>Allah is extremely loving and caring</p>
    <p>Rabb includes the name Master and gift giver</p>
    <p>Malik only includes the name Master</p>
    <p>Rahma or love and care of Allah is being removed from the conversation now</p>
    <p>Malik means owner and king</p>
    <p>A owner owns small things and a king owns big things like a kingdom</p>
    <p>A king cannot control every small detail</p>
    <p>Allah is the king and an owner at the same time</p>
    <p>Allah has full control on the day of judgment both big and small</p>
    <p>On the day of judgment big things will happen mountains will erupt and oceans will boil</p>
    <p>This requires the authority of a king</p>
    <p>Every small deed of ours is also counted on the day of judgment</p>
    <p>Day is a unit of time</p>
    <p>Human beings have expierence of ownership but we will never own time</p>
    <p>Allah takes ownership of time which only He can take ownership of</p>
    <p>Allah can make this day 50,000 years because he owns and controls it</p>
    <p>Time is like a bag and we are inside this bag</p>
    <p>When Allah owns the day He owns everything inside that day</p>
    <p>Everything Allah created exists inside of time</p>
    <p>Ad Deen means Judgment</p>
    <p>How you deal with someone and how you will be dealt with</p>
    <p>It is the completing of the record which is why we say Alhamdulillah</p>
    <p>Humans beings desire justice expecially for other people</p>
    <p>This world is unfair and a day will come where justice will be served</p>
    <p>No crime will go uncompensated</p>
    <p>Think of a number line you have positive, neutral, and negative</p>
    <p>The Love and Care of Allah is positive</p>
    <p>The Justice of Allah is neutral</p>
    <p>The Punishment of Allah is negative</p>
    <p>Allah does not compare His Love and Care with His punishment</p>
    <p>But rather He compares His Love and Care with His Justice</p>
    <p>It is the Justice of Allah that drives people into the hell fire</p>
    <p>It is the Love and Care of Allah that drives people into Jannah</p>

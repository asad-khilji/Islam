    <nav></nav>

    <main>

    <p>The first three ayat of Surah Al Fatihah introduce us to Allah</p>
    <p>Praise and Thanks belongs to Allah because He is Rabb, Ar Rahman, Ar Raheem, and Malik Yom Ad Deen</p>
    <p>When someone is extremely loving and caring, people take adavantage of their love and care</p>
    <p>Some people take it as an open license to do whatever they want</p>
    <p>Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem is two most beautiful qualities of Allah</p>
    <p>But it can create an imbalance in people and people can take advantage of the love and care of Allah</p>
    <p>There is a story of a Master and a slave</p>
    <p>The Master tells the slave do whatever you want but do not cross the fence</p>
    <p>One day the slave goes close to the line and trips on the other side of the fence</p>
    <p>The master sees and says nothing</p>
    <p>The next day the slave pretends to fall and master says nothing</p>
    <p>Now the slave has one foot on one side of the fence and the other foot on the other side of the fence</p>
    <p>The master says nothing</p>
    <p>The slave spends all his time on the other side of the fence</p>
    <p>Then one day the master calls the slave over</p>
    <p>The master says to the slave remeber I told you not to cross the fence</p>
    <p>The slave says yes</p>
    <p>The master says I recorded all the times you crossed the fence and decided to punish you now all at once</p>
    <p>We call Allah our Master and He told us not to cross certain lines</p>
    <p>When some of us slip into sin we immediately repent and turn back to Allah</p>
    <p>Then we realize nothing happened and that Allah is extremely loving and caring so we fall more into sin</p>
    <p>When people remind us not to sin we often say Allah is Ar Rahman Ar Raheem</p>
    <p>Allah is extremely loving and caring</p>
    <p>Rabb includes the name Master and gift giver</p>
    <p>Malik only includes the name Master</p>
    <p>Rahma or love and care of Allah is being removed from the conversation now</p>
    <p>Malik means owner and king</p>
    <p>A owner owns small things and a king owns big things like a kingdom</p>
    <p>A king cannot control every small detail</p>
    <p>Allah is the king and an owner at the same time</p>
    <p>Allah has full control on the day of judgment both big and small</p>
    <p>On the day of judgment big things will happen mountains will erupt and oceans will boil</p>
    <p>This requires the authority of a king</p>
    <p>Every small deed of ours is also counted on the day of judgment</p>
    <p>Day is a unit of time</p>
    <p>Human beings have expierence of ownership but we will never own time</p>
    <p>Allah takes ownership of time which only He can take ownership of</p>
    <p>Allah can make this day 50,000 years because he owns and controls it</p>
    <p>Time is like a bag and we are inside this bag</p>
    <p>When Allah owns the day He owns everything inside that day</p>
    <p>Everything Allah created exists inside of time</p>
    <p>Ad Deen means Judgment</p>
    <p>How you deal with someone and how you will be dealt with</p>
    <p>It is the completing of the record which is why we say Alhamdulillah</p>
    <p>Humans beings desire justice expecially for other people</p>
    <p>This world is unfair and a day will come where justice will be served</p>
    <p>No crime will go uncompensated</p>
    <p>Think of a number line you have positive, neutral, and negative</p>
    <p>The Love and Care of Allah is positive</p>
    <p>The Justice of Allah is neutral</p>
    <p>The Punishment of Allah is negative</p>
    <p>Allah does not compare His Love and Care with His punishment</p>
    <p>But rather He compares His Love and Care with His Justice</p>
    <p>It is the Justice of Allah that drives people into the hell fire</p>
    <p>It is the Love and Care of Allah that drives people into Jannah</p>
    <p>There is one scene on Judgment</p>
    <p>You are walking past ready with your book in your right hand in front of you turned towards laytul qadr</p>
    <p>The angels say its ok you can go into Jannah</p>
    <p>And you enter Jannah without being questioned</p>
    <p>Some people have this privalege of an easy auditing on Judgment day</p>
    <p>Human Being what deluded you and turned you away from your Generous Rabb</p>
    <p>Allah is saying I was extremely loving and caring with you</p>
    <p>Allah gave us so many chances and we took advantage of those chances</p>
    <p>You remembered Ar Rahman and Ar Raheem but forgot about Malik Yom Ad Deem</p>
    <p>How could you do that to yourself</p>
    <p>In these first three ayat of the Fatihah is the complete introduction to Allah</p>
    <p>Here Allah is talking about Himself</p>
    <p>In the next few ayat in the Fatihah we are talking to Allah</p>
    <p>It is a direct conversation between us and Allah</p>
    <p>Fatihah is teaching us we have to engage in a conversation with Allah</p>
    <p>First Allah is talking to us and now we are talking to Allah</p>
    <p>No one is between us and Allah, we have a direct connection with Allah</p>
    <p>Messengers came to connect the people with Allah</p>
    <p>Every person is being honored in the Fatihah because Allah the Most High is talking to you and me directly</p>
    <p>Important people talk to the crowd but the crowd do not get to talk to important people</p>
    <p>Allah addresses all of humanity and now we are engaging in conversation with Allah</p>

    <a href="index.html"><h1>The Quran from a Literary Perspective</h1></a>

    <nav></nav>

    <main>

    <p>We will try to understand the ayat of the Quran</p>
    <p>A zoomed in view of how the Quran is structured</p>
    <p>It is like looking at a beautiful garden and zooming in on one flower and appreciating its beauty</p>
    <p>We will look at the Quran as Literature</p>
    <p>Then the Quran will be taught in the Literature Department</p>
    <p>In the Literature Department the Quran will be taught to appreciate its beauty</p>
    <p>An ayah is the most fascinating word of the Arabic language</p>
    <p>Ayat consists of three root letter hamza, ya, and ya</p>
    <p>Ayat are something that is valuable</p>
    <p>Everything we experience is valuable</p>
    <p>Every day, problem, and challenge is valuable</p>
    <p>Every one and thing in existence is valuable</p>
    <p>Every day and night is valuable</p>
    <p>Something that makes you curious or ask questions</p>
    <p>Something that gives you a sense of direction towards Allah</p>
    <p>Something that is Amazing and it is supposed to make you wonder</p>
    <p>Those who don't believe in Allah are never amazed</p>
    <p>The believer is always amazed and happy</p>
    <p>Every Ayah is a source of amazement and wonder</p>
    <p>An Ayah gets your attention and calls you towards Allah</p>
    <p>Humans must pay attention to everything around them</p>
    <p>If you pay attention you learn lessons</p>
    <p>If you don't pay attention you learn nothing</p>
    <p>An Ayah convinces you that everything is from Allah</p>
    <p>An Ayah convinces you that it is from Allah</p>
    <p>Heavens and earth have enough Ayah to be convince</p>
    <p>An Ayah is something that has meaning</p>
    <p>Everything has meaning</p>
    <p>Your life has meaning</p>
    <p>Your life has purpose</p>
    <p>An Ayah means to have strong intention and motive and purpose</p>
    <p>An ayah is a sign from Allah</p>
    <p>There are three kinds of Arabic</p>
    <p>Spoken Arabic which is used when speaking with someone</p>
    <p>Formal Arabic which is used in writing</p>
    <p>Old Arabic or Ancient Arabic whih is used in the Quran</p>
    <p>There are big differences between all three kinds of Arabic</p>
    <p>Arabs lived in the desert for many years</p>
    <p>They had Romans, Persians, and Abyssians</p>
    <p>But everyone left Arabs alone</p>
    <p>Arabs had nothing to offer because it was just desert</p>
    <p>Oil was not discovered yet</p>
    <p>Arabs were left alone</p>
    <p>Then Arabs just talked to each other</p>
    <p>Arabs were a isolated culture</p>
    <p>Arabic became more and more refined with less outside influence</p>
    <p>Outside influence effects language</p>
    <p>Arabic for thousands of years gets really refined</p>
    <p>Like Arabs had their own language</p>
    <p>Only Arabs understand no one else from the outside understand</p>
    <p>Arabs produced the world's greatest language</p>
    <p>Arabs really took care of their language</p>
    <p>There is the story of the poet</p>
    <p>This guy was very poor and married</p>
    <p>His wife complained to him about money</p>
    <p>So he made a poem to answer his wife</p>
    <p>In the poem he said Heavy rain is at war against a house on a hill</p>
    <p>Explanation of Heavy rain is at war against a house of a hill</p>
    <p>When there is heavy rain the water goes to the bottom of the hill</p>
    <p>It floods the bottom</p>
    <p>It attacks the house but it fails and falls to the bottom</p>
    <p>The poet is saying wealth comes from Allah</p>
    <p>But I am a high person</p>
    <p>When wealth comes to me it leaves me</p>
    <p>And the wealthy are down there in the flood and the mud</p>
    <p>Islam became victorious</p>
    <p>Other nations join in</p>
    <p>Arabic starts to get outside influence</p>
    <p>When foreigners come into the country the local language dies</p>
    <p>The worst English spoken in US is NYC because it is the capital of immigration</p>
    <p>So Arabic starts to go down</p>
    <p>It takes a very short time for language to go down</p>
    <p>The Sahaba noticed that Arabic is going down</p>
    <p>There were Three Movements of Preservation</p>
    <p>To Protect the Quran which is memorized by the sahaba in their hearts</p>
    <p>To Protect Hadith which was prootected by the same Sahaba who memorized the Quran</p>
    <p>To Protect Arabic by leaving the city and going in the desert</p>
    <p>Trying to capture and record the original language</p>
    <p>The Quran came to the Arabic of the desert</p>
    <p>Here is one example between formal arabic and old arabic</p>
    <p>You have glasses and it has dirt on them</p>
    <p>When you put on dirty glasses</p>
    <p>Everything you see looks dirty</p>
    <p>Then you clean your glasses</p>
    <p>Then everything becomes clear</p>
    <p>Old Arabic is clean glasses</p>
    <p>New Arabic is dirty glasses</p>
    <p> When you look at a diamond with dirty glasses you see some dirt</p>
    <p>When you look at a diamond with clean glasses it looks much better</p>
    <p>We have to look at the Quran with Old Arabic or Classical Arabic</p>
    <p>Classical Arabic died in the Desert</p>
    <p>But it is protected so we can dig and find it</p>
    <p>It is a history and research study</p>

    <p>Allah translates other speech to Arabic in the Quran

        Firawn did not speak Arabic
        Musa did not speak Arabic
        Lost in translation
        Translating cannot get the perfect translation
        The words and emotions and complete scene is translated
        Allah now left us the legacy of translation
        Salman al Farsi wrote a translation of Fatiha in Persian
        Same one is used until today
        Surah Ali Imran and Maryam
        
        Zachariah will not speak for 3 days
        Zahariah will not speak for 3 nights
        The angels repeated themselves
        Imran is about bring this into the day
        Light and hope making things transparent
        Maryam is about dark texture
        Dua made at night
        It depends on the mood of the passage
        Summary of the Life of the Prophet â€“ Surah Ar Rad
        
        Allah sent water from the sky
        Then the valleys started getting flooded
        Then the flood waters started carrying the foam
        Another kind of foam is when you light fire and melt gold
        To purify it from the impurities
        You want to mold it to make something beautiful
        As far as what benefits people it will be stationed in the earth
        And what does not benefit people will not last
        And that is the example that Allah gives
        Example Explained
        
        The Quran came from the sky
        It went into every home
        The disbelievers rose up and were separated from the believers
        The filth is deeply inside within the community
        Allah purified the believers
        Allah called the sahaba gold
        Allah called the disbelievers filth
        Gold is Jannah
        Utensils are victory in this world
        We remember the entire seerah next time we see rain
        How Islam is to be carried to the world today?
        We cannot go to war against disbelievers until they fully knew Islam</p>

    <main>

    <p>Allah gives the example in the Quran of tying a knot</p>
    <p>Pillars hold a building up</p>
    <p>Take two beams and tie them together</p>
    <p>This is a weak kind of tying and it could come apart</p>
    <p>When he tying is made strong it is a done deal and it will not come apart</p>
    <p>Quran uses the stronger and permanent form of tying to those who make shirk</p>
    <p>Allah says Have they tied the knot meaning made a firm and final decision to do shirk with Allah</p>
    <p>Allah said if they tied their rope then Allah tied their rope</p>
    <p>It is sealed and there is no turning back</p>
    <p>Polytheists tying rope a verb is used, so it is temporary</p>
    <p>Allah tying a knot a noun is used, so it is permanent</p>
    <p>Allah says You see the poets venture into every valley</p>
    <p>This example is like A camel who is looking for water and wandering aimlessly in every direction</p>
    <p>or Love that can get you killed</p>
    <p>A Mother killing herself in stress</p>
    <p>Poet is being described as someone ready to humiliate himself</p>
    <p>You can go down a valley, but you may not be able to go back up</p>
    <p>They venture into the valley despite the danger</p>
    <p>Poets were the entertainers of the time for music, movies, and philosophy</p>
    <p>A song lasts for a short while then people get bored</p>
    <p>In the world of entertainment the audience always want something new</p>
    <p>The entertainers life revolves around peoples attention</p>
    <p>To get their attention they do whatever they can, even drop their standards</p>
    <p>The entertainers became very desperate for attention</p>
    <p>So the entertainers venture into a new valley</p>
    <p>They stay in the world of what if…? Which has no end</p>
    <p>The Quran teaches us to stay in the world of what is…?</p>
    <p>Look at the reality around you and your own self</p>
    <p>We must have clarity of thought and pull people out of the valleys</p>
    <p>Allah says in the Quran The town is turned over on its Arsh</p>
    <p>Arsh is used for the ceiling and trellis</p>
    <p>Trellis is support for newly sprouted plants</p>
    <p>Surah Al Kahf the gardeners garden is surrounded by palm trees</p>
    <p>The palm trees acted as giving fruits and protection for delicate plants in center</p>
    <p>When Allah destroy the garden the trellis fell on the delicate plants</p>
    <p>There is a similar example in surah baqarah</p>
    <p>Sometimes Allah destroys a time in natural disasters</p>
    <p>After the disaster the buildings are there but it is damaged</p>
    <p>There are no people to maintain it</p>
    <p>The roof is the weakest of the building</p>
    <p>Then roof falls down over time</p>
    <p>Then the four walls eventually fall on the roof</p>
    <p>This takes centuries</p>
    <p>6 times Allah uses Madinah</p>
    <p>1 time Allah uses Yathrib</p>
    <p>Yathrib is the original name of the city</p>
    <p>Madinah tun Nabi is the city of the Prophet</p>
    <p>Hypocrites were not loyal to the Prophet</p>
    <p>Hypocrites did not like the word Madinah</p>
    <p>Hypocrites do not openly expose it</p>
    <p>Madinah means the governorship is in the hand of the Prophet</p>
    <p>Hypocrties use Madinah to pretend he is loyal to the Prophet</p>
    <p>In times of ease Hypocrites call the city Madinah</p>
    <p>During the battle of Ahzab Hypocrites say O people come back to Yathrib</p>
    <p>The use of the word Yathrib proves they were not loyal to Prophet</p>
    <p>Allah exposes the hypocrites through their own mouth in hard times</p>
    <p>The difference between Surah Saad and Surah Qaf</p>
    <p>Allah says Rather they found it strange</p>
    <p>Both surahs use a different word for strange</p>
    <p>A warner comes with dangerous information from outside</p>
    <p>The prophet is from within them and warning from outside</p>
    <p>They call Prophet a liar that repeats lie over and over</p>
    <p>Liar does not repeat the lie to same people after he has been called out</p>
    <p>Magic is about something that is in the unseen</p>
    <p>Kuffar admitted that it cannot be explained</p>
    <p>It is out of this world</p>
    <p>Prophet being called a liar over and over again is a compliment</p>
    <p>Because the Prophet is persistent in preaching the truth to the same people</p>
    <p>It is an admission of the commitment of the Prophet</p>
    <p>Surah Saad three things are strange</p>
    <p>Surah Qaf one thing is strange</p>
    <p>Surah Saad has three more degrees of emphasis</p>

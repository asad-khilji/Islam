    <nav></nav>

    <main>

    <p>In language there are different ways of saying something</p>
    <p>For instance we have…</p>
    <p>I give and I give up</p>
    <p>I give means to give something like a gift</p>
    <p>I give up means to quit</p>
    <p>There is also sight and site</p>
    <p>Sight means to see</p>
    <p>Site means a construction site for a construction worker</p>
    <p>Site could also mean a website site for a web developer</p>
    <p>A Journal could mean different things to different people</p>
    <p>An accounting journal</p>
    <p>An academic journal</p>
    <p>A personal journal</p>
    <p>Language is alive and dynamic and it has different figures of speech</p>
    <p>For instance Its cool, its popping, its cracking meaning its awesome</p>
    <p>Its cool is also talking about the weather</p>
    <p>Words are not meant literally</p>
    <p>What’s up meaning what is above you</p>
    <p>Whats up meaning how are you</p>
    <p>Allah uses figures of speeches in the Quran</p>
    <p>Coolness of the Eyes meaning shedding tears of joy</p>
    <p>Coolness of the eyes also means Finding relief from a storm</p>
    <p>Coolness of the eyes also means When something stays in one place</p>
    <p>Warmness of the eyes used to curse someone</p>
    <p>May your eyes become warm meaning may you suffer sadness</p>
    <p>May your eyes become warm meaning may you shed tears of sadness</p>
    <p>For example there are two mothers at the airport</p>
    <p>One mother is picking up her son and the other mother is dropping her son</p>
    <p>The mother picking up her son is expierencing coolness of the eyes</p>
    <p>The mother dropping her son is expierencing the warmness of the eyes</p>
    <p>When Arabs would travel in the desert they would wear heavy clothes wrapping themselves</p>
    <p>But he cannot cover his eyes because he needs to see</p>
    <p>Then there is a sand storm and his eyes are warm he cant see</p>
    <p>Then he finds a cave and he can open his eyes and his eyes are cool</p>
    <p>An assassin once said the eyes of my people will stay warm and the blood of my sword will cool them</p>
    <p>There is a dua in the Quran which says O Allah give us from our Spouses and children the coolness of our eyes</p>
    <p>Our spouses and children are a refuge from the storm</p>
    <p>The outside world is a storm and the house is a relief from the storm</p>
    <p>When you come back home to your spouses and children you find relief</p>
    <p>And your eyes are cooled</p>
    <p>We feel safe and the storm cannot hit us anymore</p>
    <p>We want a happy house</p>
    <p>We cry tears of joy looking at our spouses and children</p>
    <p>In Surah Qasas the mother of Musa threw Musa in the river then her eyes became warm</p>
    <p>The mother of musa is reunited with Musa and her eyes become cool</p>
    <p>The wife of Firawn expierences the warmness of the eyes with Firawn</p>
    <p>The wife of Firawn expierences the coolness of the eyes with baby Musa</p>
    <p>Musa finds the warmness of the eyes while talking with his nation</p>
    <p>Musa finds the coolness of the eyes while talking with Allah</p>
    <p>Prophet Muhammad finds the warmness of his eyes when talking with his people</p>
    <p>The Prophet Muhammad finds the coolness of his eyes when talking to Allah in salah</p>
    <p>Allah says to lower your wings of humility out of love and care for your parents</p>
    <p>A man does not have wings</p>
    <p>It means to be humble</p>
    <p>A person is being compared to a bird</p>
    <p>When a bird raises its wings it is about to fly</p>
    <p>When a bird lowers its wings it is about to land</p>
    <p>Lower your wings means come back down to earth</p>
    <p>When the bird has wings it lowers them</p>
    <p>A child lowers his or her wings of humility before their parents</p>
    <p>Our parents did everything for us</p>
    <p>Children need to be humble before their parents when we grow up</p>
    <p>When we grow up we have everything but we must lower our wings to our parents because of the love and care they showed children</p>
    <p>Children must genuinely show love and care to parents</p>
    <p>Children sacrificing for the parents like parents did for children</p>
    <p>The roles are reversed</p>
    <p>Musa makes a dua to Allah to untie the tongue from my tongue</p>
    <p>a knot is in a string</p>
    <p>Like in wires and threads</p>
    <p>When you have a Knot that is jumbled up you do not know where it begins or where it ends</p>
    <p>It is unclear and confusing</p>
    <p>Untie the knot of my tongue means to give clarity in speech</p>
    <p>To not get nervous when speaking with people</p>
    <p>A clear beginning, a clear middle, and a clear end</p>
    <p>To remain calm and not get angry or frustrated</p>

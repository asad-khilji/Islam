    <main>

   <p>Allah says I have divided the prayer between Me and My slave into two halves</p>
   <p>Half of it is for Me and the other half is for My slave</p>
   <p>When we say Praise and thanks is for Allah, Master of all nations and people</p>
   <p>Allah says My slave has praised Me</p>
   <p>When we say the extremely loving and caring right now, the always extremely loving and caring</p>
   <p>Allah says My slave has exalted Me</p>
   <p>When we say Master of the day of judgment</p>
   <p>Allah says My slave has glorified Me</p>
   <p>When we say You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help</p>
   <p>Allah says This is between Me and My slave and My slave shall have whatever he or she is asking for</p>
   <p>When we say Guide us to the straight path</p>
   <p>Allah says It is guranteed</p>
   <p>When we say the path of those whom You have favored</p>
   <p>Allah says It is guranteed</p>
   <p>When we say But not the path of those who are the receipents of rage</p>
   <p>Allah says It is guranteed</p>
   <p>When we say nor of the lost</p>
   <p>Allah says It is guranteed</p>
   <p>Praise and Thanks is for Allah</p>
   <p>Praise and Thanks are two different ideas</p>
   <p>You can praise without thanking</p>
   <p>You can thank without praising</p>
   <p>You can praise the ocean but you do not thank the ocean</p>
   <p>Musa thanks the Pharoah for raising him, but does not praise him as a god</p>
   <p>Ibrahim thanks his father for raising him, but does not praise his worship of the idols</p>
   <p>Allah completes the phrase and says praise and thanks is for Allah</p>
   <p>We are praising and thanking Allah at the same time</p>
   <p>We must have two attitudes in mind when saying Alhamdulillah, praise and thanks</p>
   <p>This statement makes us optimistic</p>
   <p>We must have a genuine reason to praise Allah and thank Him at the same time</p>
   <p>We cannot praise Allah and complain at the same time</p>
   <p>This gives us a positive attitude in life</p>
   <p>Our deen begins with optimism and a positive attitude</p>
   <p>This is a complete change in thought and attitude</p>
   <p>Genuine and Sincere Praise and Thanks is for Allah</p>
   <p>Gratitude is limited to a reaction</p>
   <p>Allah uses the word Hamd and not shukr</p>
   <p>Hamd is a gratitude that is not limited to a reaction</p>
   <p>Allah does not need us to praise and thank Him</p>
   <p>There is a difference between nouns and verbs</p>
   <p>Nouns are timeless and not stuck in a time past, present, or future</p>
   <p>A noun does not need anyone to do it and it is independent</p>
   <p>Verbs are stuck in time being either in past, present, or future tense</p>
   <p>A verb requires someone to do it and it is dependent on someone</p>
   <p>Praise and Thanks is a noun</p>
   <p>The praise and thanks for Allah is timeless and independent</p>
   <p>Allah does not need anyone to praise and thank Him</p>
   <p>Whether we praise and thank Allah or not the praise and thank to Allah still exists</p>
   <p>If Allah commanded us to praise Him</p>
   <p>Then praise and thanks will exist only when we do it</p>
   <p>So Allah did not issue us a command to praise and thank Him</p>
   <p>There are two kinds of sentences</p>
   <p>Information sentences and emotional sentences</p>
   <p>By saying Praise and Thanks is for Allah it is a statement of information and emotion</p>
   <p>By saying For sure praise and thanks is for Allah it is a statement of information only</p>
   <p>Allah says praise and thanks is for Allah so it is both informational and emotional sentence</p>
   <p>Surah Al Fatihah says Praise and Thanks is for Allah</p>
   <p>Surah Al Jathiya says Praise and Thanks is only for Allah</p>
   <p>Praise and Thanks is only for Allah is only used when debating with someone</p>
   <p>Surah Al Fatihah is a statement from the heart and not debating with anyone</p>
   <p>Surah Al Jathiya is debating with someone</p>
   <p>Allah introduces Himself to us in Surah Al Fatihah</p>
   <p>So Allah uses His proper name which is Allah</p>
   <p>By using the name Allah you call upon all the names and attributes of Allah</p>
   <p>Allah uses His proper name Allah and it clears any confusion of praise and thanks being for anyone else</p>
   <p>Some praise and thanks could be for other people</p>
   <p>The Ultimate, Genuine, Sincere, and Timeless Praise and Thanks is for Allah who is independent from his creation</p>
   <p>Rabb consists of five names and attributes</p>
   <p>The first name is Malik or Master and Owner</p>
   <p>The second name is Sayyed or the one who is in contol and in charge</p>
   <p>The third name is Murrabi or the one who makes sure something grows, develops, improves, and takes care of it constantly</p>
   <p>The fourth name is Qayyim or someone one who makes sure something gets better and better constantly</p>
   <p>The fifth name is Munnim or the giver of gifts</p>
   <p>Everything Allah has given us is a gift</p>
   <p>We are not entitled to anything because it is gifted to us by Allah</p>
   <p>We cannot complain about anything because we do not own anything</p>
   <p>Allah is our Master and we are His slaves</p>
   <p>Slavery has some negative connotations, but Allah is a unique Master who gives gifts</p>
   <p>Human beings have this delusion of freedom</p>
   <p>We are enslaved to someone and something like money, fashion, people, government</p>
   <p>We want to be free</p>
   <p>You hate when people tell you what to do</p>
   <p>When you enslave yourself to Allah then you are free from everything else</p>
   <p>We are always slaves of Allah 24/7</p>
   <p>Salah is a practical demonastration that we are slaves of Allah</p>
   <p>So after every salah we become a better slave of Allah</p>
   <p>The Ultimate, Genuine, Sincere, and Timeless Praise and Thanks is for Allah who is independent from His creation</p>
   <p>For every generation, every culture, every nation, every people in every time and every place</p>
